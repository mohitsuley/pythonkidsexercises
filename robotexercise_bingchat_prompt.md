Going forward from the exercises you've given so far, I'd like you to help me generate a 10 more exercises. The focus here will be to give the child some exposure to typical things one needs to do when programming a robot. Language will remain Python and the expected age for child is between 10 and 12 years old. Don't use any robotics library for now. 

Please start with describing a hypothetical buggy that has 4 wheels, an arm with a servo, optical sensor, color sensor, distance sensor, touch sensor and an LED. Draw a rough sketch for the child to help visualize. Add code snippet that these puts simple objects (like front-wheels, rear-wheels, optical sensor, color sensor, distance sensor, touch sensor, servo motors for arm). Each of these should have appropriate parameters to control or read their respective values etc. Show through a well commented code example how to use this, 'simulation', if you will. The goal is to not consume a specific library for robot platform (like Spike Prime he will typically use), but build a temporary harness to build the programming skill. 

Let's first get the model and code example right and then we can proceed to the questions that I will be provide guidelines for, later in the next prompt. 

This is good, thanks! Let's start with 5 exercises based on this model. 

The exercises should be: 
1. Gradually increasing in complexity, starting with some of the simplest programming problems, like reading a light sensor. 
2. Have language that can be understood by an 10-12 year old. 
3. Initially about reading sensors and showing an output of what they mean. Then they should proceed with resulting in simple actions, like lighting up an LED (another object you can simulate.)
4. Should not be too complex. 
5. Should enable the child to make some iterative changes to code so that he can make optimizations. 
6. Should have sub-questions with hints on optimizations to make based on (5). 
7. Should have a hint section below the entire set of questions, so the child can look it up if needed. 
8. Focus initially on knowing the state of the system, and then moving. It should involve moving the buggy
9. not focusing on language expertise. 
10. focusing on developing the child's basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts. 
11. Fun! 


Please think through this plan, and if you have recommendations, I'd like for you to innovate. I will likely ask you to generate more questions once the initial set looks good.
