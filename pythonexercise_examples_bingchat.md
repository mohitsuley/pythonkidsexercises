## Exercise 8: Hangman
Write a program that plays a simple game of hangman with the user. The program should choose a random word from a list of words and then show the user how many letters are in it. The user should have 10 chances to guess a letter. If they guess correctly, the program should reveal the letter in the word. If they guess wrong, the program should draw one part of the hangman. The game ends when the user guesses the word or runs out of chances.

For example, if the word is "python", the program should show:

```
_ _ _ _ _ _
You have 10 chances left.
Guess a letter: e
Wrong!
 O 
_ _ _ _ _ _

For example, if the board looks like this:

```
X O X
O X O
_ _ _
```

The program should show:

```
X O X
O X O
_ _ _
Your turn. Enter row and column (1-3): 
3 1

```

## Exercise 10: Rock-Paper-Scissors
Write a program that plays a simple game of rock-paper-scissors with the user. The program should ask the user to choose rock, paper or scissors and then randomly choose one of them. The program should compare the choices and print the result. The rules are: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.

For example, if the user chooses rock and the program chooses paper, the program should show:

```

4
5

**Output**: The average of these numbers is: 
3

## Exercise 19: Maximum and Minimum
Write a program that asks the user for five numbers and then prints their maximum and minimum values. The maximum value of a set of numbers is the largest one among them. The minimum value of a set of numbers is the smallest one among them. For example, the maximum value of [2,4,6] is 
6, and the minimum value of [2,4,6] is 
2.

**Input**: 
7
9
2
5
8

**Output**: The maximum value of these numbers is: 
9
The minimum value of these numbers is: 
2

## Exercise 20: Guessing Game
Write a program that generates a random number between 
1 and 
10 and then asks the user to guess it. The program should give feedback to the user whether their guess is too high or too low. The user should have 3 chances to guess the number. If they guess correctly, the program should congratulate them. If they run out of chances, the program should reveal the number and end the game.

For example, if the number is 6, the program should show:

```
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.
You have 3 chances to guess it.
Guess a number: 4
Too low.
You have 2 chances left.
Guess a number: 8
Too high.
You have 1 chance left.
Guess a number: 6
Correct!
You win!
```


# Hints

## Exercise 1: Hello World
