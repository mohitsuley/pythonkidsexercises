I am teaching my 11 year old how to program using Python. He has a basic understanding of the language. I'd like you to generate a set of 10 exercises for him, with expected inputs and outputs, that he can work on in his free time. 

The exercises should be: 
1. Gradually increasing in complexity, starting with some of the simplest programming problems a child of his age can do. 
2. Have language that can be understood by an 11 year old. 
3. Based on common things we see around us, so that the child can relate to the problem. 
4. Should not be too long 
5. Should enable the child to make some iterative changes to code so that he can make optimizations. 
6. Should have sub-questions with hints on optimizations to make based on (5). 
7. Should have a hint section below the entire set of questions, so the child can look it up if needed. 
8. focusing initially on strings and manipulation, numbers, single dimension matrices, loops, conditional statement use etc. 
9. not focusing on language expertise. 
10. focusing on developing the child's basic understanding of fundamental programming concepts. 
11 Fun! 


Please think through this plan, and if you have recommendations, I'd like for you to innovate. I will likely ask you to generate more questions once the initial set looks good.




can you create 10 more such exercises in continuation, in a similar format? Some exercises related to modulo, remainder, ceiling, floor might be helpful. Please keep the initial prompt in mind while designing these as well. thanks!
